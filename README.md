Welcome to my den.

Run `npm install` and optionally run `npm install -g nodemon` if you want to use nodemon.
### If you aren't using nodemon, make sure to edit the start script in package.json accordingly.
Then run `npm start` to start the server!

And finally go to `localhost:3000` in your browser to view it.
